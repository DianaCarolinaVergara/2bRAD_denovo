2bRAD de novo walkthrough
September 15, 2014 Mikhail Matz (matz@utexas.edu)

The idea is to copy the chunks separated by empty lines below and paste them into your cluster 
terminal window consecutively. 

The lines beginning with hash marks (#) are explanations and additional instructions - 
please make sure to read them before copy-pasting. 

In addition to the scripts coming with this distribution,
you will need the following software installed and available 
(note: TACC already has them as modules):

python: http://www.python.org/getit/
fastx_toolkit: http://hannonlab.cshl.edu/fastx_toolkit/download.html
cd-hit: https://cdhit.googlecode.com/files/cd-hit-v4.6.1-2012-08-27.tgz
vcftools: http://vcftools.sourceforge.net/ 

Occasionally, an example screen output is listed after the program calls below.

NOTE: this walkthrough has been written for lonestar cluster of the Texas
Advanced Computer Center, which has 12 cores per node and uses Sun Grid Engine 
(SGE) batch processing system. To adopt the walkthough to your cluster you 
would need to edit the launcher_creator.py script to make its default settings
compatible with your cluster. 

==============================================
IMPORTANT: DO NOT SEQUENCE 2BRAD LIBRARIES ALONE ON A HISEQ4000 LANE! INVARIANT BASES
(ADAPTOR, RESTRICTION SITE) WILL NOT BE READ WELL. MIX IN 20% OF PHIX SAMPLES TO 
DIVERSIFY; OR MIX YOUR 2BRAD LIBRARIES WITH SOMEONE ELSE'S NOT-2BRAD LIBRARIES 
(JUST MAKE SURE THE BARCODES DO NOT OVERLAP) 

If you did and you have used BcgI enzyme, use 2bRAD_trim_launch_dedup2.pl for trimming
==============================================

# unzipping multiple *.gz files
ls *.gz | perl -pe 's/^(.+)$/gunzip $1/' >gunz
launcher_creator.py -j gunz -n gunz -l gj
qsub gj

# (ecogeno2013: skip this one)
# concatenating the reads files (make sure to unzip them first!):
# NOTE: Only run this chunk if your samples are spread over several lanes.
# Assuming your filed have the extension fastq (edit that in the line below if not),
# replace "2b_(.+)_L00" below with the actual pattern to recognize sample
# identifier in the file name. The pattern above will work for file names such as
# Sample_2b_K208_L007_R1.cat.fastq (the identifier is K208)
ngs_concat.pl fastq "2b_(.+)_L00"

# Trimming the reads, splitting them by secondary barcode and removing PCR duplicates
# The sampleID parameter here, '3', defines a chunk in the filename (separated
# by underscores) that is to be kept; 
# for example, for a filename like this: Sample_2b_M11_L006_R1.cat.fastq 
# it would be reasonable to specify 'sampleID=3' to keep only 'M11' as a 
# sample identifier. If the sampleID parameter is not specified, the whole filename up to the first dot will be kept.
# NOTE: if you ran ngs_concat.pl (above), run not the next but the second-next line (after removing # symbol) :
2bRAD_trim_launch_dedup.pl fastq > trims
launcher_creator.py -j trims -n trims -l trimjob
qsub trimjob

# NB: use this command instead of the one above if you have 2bRAD libraries without 
# degenerate tag but with 4-base in-line barcode:
2bRAD_trim_launch.pl fastq barcode2=4 > trims
# And if you have the original-style libraries without degenerate tag and without in-line barcode, use this:
2bRAD_trim_launch.pl fastq > trims
# AND IF you sequenced your double-barcoded, deduplicatable libraries on HiSeq 4000 alone
# (resulting in poor quality at restriction site and adaptor bases) and you have used BcgI enzyme, use this:
2bRAD_trim_launch_dedup2.pl fastq > trims


# quality filtering using fastx_toolkit
module load fastx_toolkit
ls *.tr0 | perl -pe 's/^(\S+)\.tr0$/cat $1\.tr0 \| fastq_quality_filter -q 20 -p 90 >$1\.trim/' >filt0

# NOTE: run the next line ONLY if your qualities are 33-based 
# (if you don't know just try to see if it works eventually, if you get errors from fastx_toolkit, try the other one):
	cat filt0 | perl -pe 's/filter /filter -Q33 /' > filt
#if you did NOT run the line above, run this one (after removing # symbol):
#	mv filt0 filt

launcher_creator.py -j filt -n filt -l filtjob
qsub filtjob


# uniquing individual trimmed fastq files:
ls *.trim | perl -pe 's/^(.+)$/uniquerOne.pl $1 >$1\.uni/' > unii
launcher_creator.py -j unii -n uni1 -l uni1
qsub uni1

ll *.uni | wc -l  
# do you have .uni for all your samples?... If not, rerun the chunk above

# I recommend using AB and DP filters (SB and TP don't seem to be too useful at this point)

# if you did replicates-based recalibration and your best gain was observed at 20:
# also, minimum genotype quality we want is Q15, biallelic only, present in 80% of samples:	
vcftools --vcf denovo.recal.vcf --minQ 20 --minGQ 15 --min-alleles 2 --max-alleles 2 --max-missing 0.75 --recode --recode-INFO-all --out denovo.filt0

# if you did NOT do recalibration and want (recommended) to keep loci within best 80% for each filter (AB and meanDP):
# consult the output from filterStats.pl (above) to see which filter values correspond to 80%
# in vcftools, AB would correspond to --minQ, meanDP range is set by --min-meanDP and --max-meanDP:
vcftools --vcf cdh_alltags.ul_Variants_count10_ab10_sb10_clip0.vcf --minQ 29 --min-meanDP 23 --max-meanDP 102 --recode --recode-INFO-all --out denovo.filt0
# After filtering, kept 132 out of 132 Individuals
# After filtering, kept 26023 out of a possible 76865 Sites

# discarding loci with too many heterozygotes, which are likely lumped paralogs
# (by default, fraction of heterozygotes should not exceed maxhet=0.75)
# this step can also filter for the fraction of missing genotypes (default maxmiss=0.5)
